            "Creating a chatbot like SUPRV GPT involves a series of crucial steps that work together to bring the AI to life. The first step is defining the chatbot's purpose, ensuring it understands the problem it's solving and how it will interact with users. For SUPRV GPT, the goal is to provide personalized, accurate, and efficient responses related to accommodation rental, making it an essential tool for users looking to book or inquire about accommodations. Once the purpose is clear, the next phase is developing the chatbot, which includes designing its functionality and dialogue flow. This is where Python comes into play as the main programming language. Python is chosen for its simplicity and powerful capabilities, making it an ideal choice for building AI applications. Several libraries and frameworks are employed during this process. NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit) is used for natural language processing, enabling the chatbot to understand and interpret user input. TensorFlow, a popular machine learning framework, is used to train and fine-tune the chatbot's underlying model, allowing it to generate human-like responses based on patterns it learns from data. To ensure the chatbot's interactions are smooth and user-friendly, Streamlit is used to build an intuitive web interface where users can engage with the bot in real-time. The final stage involves training the model on data specific to the domain—accommodation rental—and deploying the chatbot to make it accessible to users across different platforms. Each step, from development to deployment, requires careful attention and testing to ensure the chatbot functions effectively and offers users a seamless experience. Through this process, SUPRV GPT becomes more than just a chatbot—it transforms into a valuable assistant that helps users navigate the complexities of accommodation booking with ease"
